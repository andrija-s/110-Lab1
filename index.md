## About Me
My name is Andrija Šunjić, I go by **Andy**. I was born in Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia. It's a long name for a little place. I am currently studying Computer Science at University of California, San Diego.

Here is a quote I found by typing "Oscar Wilde" into google:
>Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.
